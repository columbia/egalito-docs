Chunk Intermediate Representation
=================================

This documentation is forthcoming.

Egalito parses ELF inputs into low-level data structures using code in
``src/elf/``. This information is lifted into Chunk IR using code in
``src/chunk/`` and the passes that iterate over IR are in ``src/pass/``.
